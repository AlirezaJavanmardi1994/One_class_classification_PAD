Face Spoofing detection using one class classification
One-class pattern classification is a preferred method by most researchers for presentation attack detection. Due to the focus of this technique on bonafide images, unseen attacks would more confidently be detected. This approach consists of different parts including a feature extractor model and anomaly detection algorithm. In this paper, we exploited VGG-face model with VGG-16 architecture which has been trained on a large dataset consisting of 2.6 m face images from more than 2.6 k clients. For the reason that, face patches have been used instead of full part of the face image in this work, and also regarding the hierarchical feature representation of the CNNs, we considered feature extractor model with different layers. It is shown that using validation set for evaluating the performance of one-class classifier utilizing different layers of the VGG-face model has shown remarkable differences compared to the entire architecture.
Support vector data description(SVDD) is an anomaly detection extention of SVM which is based on the discrimination of features. This method uses a hypersphere to enclose real data  points and through an optimization procedure, tries to minimize the radius R>0 of the hypersphere with center z. By doing so, the probability of false accepting the outliers will decrease. Considering a set of N training data and âˆ… as a function to map the data points to a higher-dimensional space
